the following project deals with decentralisation of money using ethereum which is platform for blockchain. the service for this project runs on node js and can be started by navigating into the project root directory and executing the command "node index". however there is another service which hosts mongo db that has to be running before the above given command will be run. in order to start the mongo server you must have the mongo db client installed on your device. navigate into the mongodb bin directory and run command "mongod --dbpath <path_to_db>" after that run the mongo service using the command "mongo". we also need to install the dependencies of the project and a blockchain provider, "ganache" in this case, to simulate a wallet based real time scenaraios. after the completion of the prerequisites, run the command "node index" in the root directory of the project. navigate to your browser and access url "localhost:8000", this will take you to  the login page, which recognizes faces in order to grant access to users. the face recognition system has been traned to detect me and my teammates faces. once authenticated you will be redirected to a dash board where you can send money to other users and  even accept or decline incoming request for transactions.
